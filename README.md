## Prefect Flow Example

Below is an example of a completed flow which ingests data from the Chess.com API,
transforms the data into a format suitable for loading into BigQuery, loads the
data into BigQuery, and calls `dbt` to rerun all downstream models reliant on this data.
The flow is scheduled to run every 24 hours.
